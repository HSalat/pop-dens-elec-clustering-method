This repository contains the supporting code for the article: [Salat, Smoreda, Schl√§pfer, A method to estimate population densities and electricity consumption from mobile phone data in developing countries. PLoS One, 2020. DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0235224](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0235224)

The project is meant to be used as a single workspace (variables created in one file are called directly from other files).

Only the content of the repository is described here, for a description of the methods, please refer to the article.

## Data

Some of the public and non sensitive data are stored on OSF. The rest can only be accessed by requesting permission from Orange/Sonatel.

Data provided on [OSF](https://osf.io/q29a7/):
- `individus.csv` and `habitat.csv` are extracts from the 2013 Census in Senegal.
- `Senegal_Communes_552.shp` is a shapefile of Senegal according to the official division into 552 communes from December 2013.
- `popelec.csv` contains population density and electrification rates at Commune level estimated from the Census by Georges Vivien Houngbonon (ghoungbonon@ifc.org).
- `S1_File.csv` - Supplementary data given with the article containing general information (population density, nighttime light intensity, mobile phone activity) aggregated at Voronoi neighbourhood level around each antenna site (1666 sites).
- `S2_File.csv` - Identical to previous file but at Commune level (552 Communes).
- `S3_File.csv` - Supplementary data given with the article containing a sample time series at active antenna sites level (1298 active sites out of 1666) for January 2013. It can be used to test the clustering methods.

Data not provided:
- Localisation of the antenna sites.
- Full call details records for the year 2013 in Senegal.

## Files

- `data-clustering-curves.R` creates the distance matrices between mobile phone activity curves to apply the clustering algorithm on. In addition, it contains an alternative method to replace distance matrices by a feature table containing curve characteristics (such as seasonality, skewness...) to operate the clustering. There are also a number of plots that were used to generate illustrations for the article. 
- `data-clustering-network.R` creates basic OD data of mobile phone activity that can be easily tramsformed into adjacency matrices / igraph networks for analysis. It also provides some visualisations of the networks.
- `functions.R` groups a number of utility functions to prepare the data and create visualisations. Most are ad-hoc variants of usual functions created to have more control over hidden details when trying different methods or simply adapted to the specific situation. An automated version of the purity-based clustering is presented at the end. The main clustering method is not automated and must be operated using `results-clustering.R`.
- `results-correlations-table1.R` contains the code to compute Table 1 of the article (up to l. 128) and some visualisations, additional tests and interesting alternatives methods that were not included in the final article.

The data loaded by `Data-general.R` is essential to run all other files.
